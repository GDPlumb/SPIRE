The goal is to predict whether or not the two objects have the same shape

Experiment 1: Spurious Correlation with the Background color

Experiment 2: Spurious Correlation with the Letter

Experiment 3: Spurious Correlation with Color

Experiment 4: Spurious Correlation with Location
-  We are ignoring this for now

Implementation Notes
-  We train the models to predict false whenever there are not two objects in the image
