General Comment:  
-  The HPS was run with a more aggressive stopping condition to get results faster
-  Given that these methods tend to improve consistently for a few epochs and then stop improving at all, this shouldn't change the results much

rrr-tune
-  The best accuracy was with a weight of 0.1, but that failed to meaningfully changed the regularizer objective
-  So we are going to use the next best weight of 10 which was only slightly less accurate

gs-transfer
-  The best accuracy was with a weight of 1.0
-  This did change the regularizer objective but I'm not sure why train/val are always moving in the opposite direction

gs-tune
-  Same results as gs-transfer but better accuracy
-  After running bottle-person, it turned out that this configuration behaved almost exactly like initial-tune in terms of both the accuracy and the search results
  -  So we are going to use a a weight of 10

cdep-transfer
-  The best accuracy was with a weight of 1.0
-  Weights of 10.0 and above caused the model to fail to learn

cdep-tune
-  This performs worse than cdep-transfer
