General Comment:  
-  The HPS was run with a more aggressive stopping condition to get results faster
-  Given that these methods tend to improve consistently for a few epochs and then stop improving at all, this shouldn't have changed the results much
-  The final results are run with a less aggressive stopping condition

RRR
-  This method requires that the model be fine tuned
-  While the best accuracy result was from a weight of 0.1, models trained with this weight failed to meaningful change the regularizer's objective
-  As a result, we will use the next best weight of 10

GS
-  The best accuracy was with a weight of 100.0 and transfer learning the fine tuned model
CDEP
-  The best accuracy result was with a weight of 1.0 and transfer learning the fine tuned model
